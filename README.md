## Abstract
This protocol outlines the process and structure to use Google Sheets utilizing Google Apps Script to set up and manage an online 6-3-5 brainwriting session, which enables remote collaborative sessions for idea generation. This technique creates a structured online platform by automating traditional brainwriting sessions, which involve six participants each coming up with three ideas per round and passing their paper round-robin to the next participant  building new ideas upon previous contributions over the course of six rounds. 

Google Sheets functions as a versatile platform for real-time input collection and documentation while enabling participants to effortlessly browse on the spreadsheet and contribute to the idea development process. By following this protocol, moderators conduct and record brainstorming sessions in remote or hybrid settings in a fully functional online 6-3-5 brainwriting system that tracks progress automatically, manages participant contributions, and captures a total of 108 ideas (6 participants × 6 rounds × 3 ideas per participant per round) in a structured worksheet format.


## Before starting
### Research the Focus Area:
Before initiating the brainwriting session, thoroughly research the research question or focus area. Ensure you have a clear understanding of the topic and the specific goals you aim to achieve through the session.
Prepare a concise, well-defined problem statement or objective to guide participants effectively during the session.

### Prepare for Implementation:
Familiarize yourself with the Google Apps Script and ensure you understand its functionality. Review the provided script, make any necessary adjustments for your specific needs, and test it to confirm it works as intended.
Set up the Google Sheet according to the instructions in this protocol. Name worksheets and assign participant worksheet names before sharing the file.

### Test the Setup:
Conduct a trial run with a small group or colleagues to identify any potential issues with the script, permissions, or workflow. Address any bugs or limitations before implementing the session with your actual participants.

### Ensure Participant Readiness:
Inform participants about the session's structure and expectations beforehand. Share the session agenda, objectives, and any guidelines for contributing ideas.
Verify that all participants have stable internet connectivity and access to Google Sheets. Provide instructions for accessing the shared file
